\section{Conclusions and future work}

In this paper, we have defined a \clos{} protocol for manipulating
text editor buffers.

\subsection{Layer for Emacs compatibility}

We plan to define a protocol layer on top of the edit protocols with
operations that have the same semantics as the buffer protocol of GNU
Emacs.  Mainly, this work involves hiding the existence of individual
lines, and treating the separation between lines as if it contained a
\emph{newline} character.

When a cursor is moved forward beyond the end of a line, or backward
beyond the beginning of a line, this compatibility layer will have to
detach the cursor from the line that it is currently attached to and
re-attach it to the following or preceding line as appropriate.

Other minor operations need to be adapted, such as computing the item
count of the entire buffer.  This calculation will have to consider
the separation of each pair of lines to contribute another item to the
item count of the buffer.
