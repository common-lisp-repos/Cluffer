\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Many applications and libraries contain a data structure for storing
and editing text.  Frequently, this data structure is chosen in a
somewhat arbitrary way, without taking into account typical use cases
and their consequence to performance.  In this paper, we present a
data structure in the form of a \clos{} protocol (together with two
implementations of it) that addresses these issues.  In particular,
the protocol is divided into an \emph{edit} protocol and an
\emph{update} protocol, designed to be executed at different
frequencies.  The update protocol is based on the concept of
\emph{time stamps} allowing multiple \emph{views} without any need for
\emph{observers} or similar techniques for informing the views of
changes to the model (i.e., the text buffer).
