\section{Conditions}

\sysname{} defines a number of conditions that are signaled when
\sysname{} is unable to fulfill the contract stipulated by the
protocol function being used.

\Defcondition {cluffer:cluffer-error}

This condition type is the base of all error conditions signaled by
\sysname{}.  Client code that wishes to handle all error conditions
signaled by \sysname{} may use this condition in its condition
handlers.

\Defcondition {cluffer:end-of-line}

This condition is signaled when an attempt is made to use a
position that is too large, either by moving a cursor there, or by
attempting to access an item in such a position.  Notice that in
some cases, "too large" means "strictly greater than the number of
items in a line", and sometimes it means "greater than or equal to
the number of items in a line".  For example, it is perfectly
acceptable to move a cursor to a position that is equal to the
number of items in a line, but it is not acceptable to attempt to
access an item in a line at that position.
