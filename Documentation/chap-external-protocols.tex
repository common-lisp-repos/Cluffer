\chapter{External protocols}

\section{Package}

All symbols in the external protocol are in the package named
\texttt{cluffer}.  We recommend against client code \emph{using} this
package in the sense of the \texttt{:use} option to
\texttt{defpackage} or in the sense of calling \texttt{use-package}.

The reason for this recommendation is that we can not guarantee that
future additions to this library will not define external symbols that
conflict with symbols in the \texttt{common-lisp} package.

Instead, we recommend that client code use explicit package prefixes,
which in addition will make the origin of the symbol obvious from the
source code.

If, for some reason, it is not desirable to use explicit package
prefixes, we suggest selectively importing the desired symbols.
