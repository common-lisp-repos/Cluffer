\Defclass {cursor}

This is the base class for all cursors.

\Defclass {detached-cursor}

This is the base class for all detached cursors.  It is a subclass of
\texttt{cursor}.  A detached cursor is a cursor that is not attached
to any line.

\Defclass {attached-cursor}

This is the base class for all attached cursors.  It is a subclass of
\texttt{cursor}.

\Definitarg {:line}

The class \texttt{cursor} accepts this initarg which is the line to
which the new cursor is to be attached.

\Defgeneric {beginning-of-line-p} {cursor}

Return \textit{true} if and only if \textit{cursor} is located at the
beginning of a line.

\Defgeneric {end-of-line-p} {cursor}

Return \textit{true} if and only if \textit{cursor} is located at the
end of a line.

\Defgeneric {beginning-of-line} {cursor}

Position \textit{cursor} at the very beginning of the line.

\Defgeneric {end-of-line} {cursor}

Position \textit{cursor} at the very end of the line.

\Defgeneric {forward-item} {cursor}

Move \textit{cursor} forward one position.  If \emph{cursor} is at the
end of the line, the error condition \texttt{end-of-line} will be
signaled.

\Defgeneric {backward-item} {cursor}

Move \textit{cursor} backward one position.  If \emph{cursor} is at
the beginning of the line, the error condition
\texttt{beginning-of-line} will be signaled.

\Defgeneric {insert-item} {cursor item}

Insert an item at the location of \textit{cursor}.  After this
operation, any left-sticky cursor located at the same position as
\textit{cursor} will be located before \textit{item}, and any
right-sticky cursor located at the same position as \textit{cursor}
will be located after \textit{item}.

\Defgeneric {delete-item} {cursor}

Delete the item immediately to the right of \emph{cursor}.  If
\emph{cursor} is at the end of the line, the error condition
\texttt{end-of-line} will be signaled.

\Defgeneric {erase-item} {cursor}

Delete the item immediately to the left of \emph{cursor}.  If
\emph{cursor} is at the beginning of the line, the error condition
\texttt{beginning-of-line} will be signaled.

\Defgeneric {item-after-cursor} {cursor}

Return the item located immediately to the right of \textit{cursor}.
If \emph{cursor} is at the end of the line, the error condition
\texttt{end-of-line} will be signaled.

\Defgeneric {item-before-cursor} {cursor}

Return the item located immediately to the left of \textit{cursor}.
If \emph{cursor} is at the beginning of the line, the error condition
\texttt{beginning-of-line} will be signaled.

\Defgeneric {detach-cursor} {cursor}

The class of \textit{cursor} is changed to \texttt{detached-cursor}
and it is removed from the line it was initially located in. 

If \textit{cursor} is already detached, this operation has no effect.

\Defgeneric {attach-cursor} {cursor line \optional (position 0)}

Attach \textit{cursor} to \textit{line} at \textit{position}.  If
\textit{position} is supplied and it is greater than the number of
items in \textit{line}, the error condition \texttt{end-of-line} is
signaled.  If \textit{cursor} is already attached to a line, the error
condition \texttt{cursor-attached} will be signaled.

\Defgeneric {cursor-position} {cursor}

Return the position of \textit{cursor} as two values: the line number
and the item number within the line. 

\Defgeneric {item-count} {cursor}

Return the number of items in the line in which \textit{cursor} is
located.

\Defgeneric {line} {cursor}

Return the line in which \textit{cursor} is located.
