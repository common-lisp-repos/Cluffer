\section{Introduction}

Many applications and libraries contain a data structure for storing
and editing text.  In a simple input editor, it can be a single,
relatively short, line of text, whereas in a complete text editor,
texts with thousands of lines must be supported.

In terms of abstract data types, one can think of an editor buffer as
an \emph{editable sequence}.  The problem of finding a good data
structure for such a data type is made more interesting because a data
structure with optimal asymptotic worst-case complexity would be
considered as having too much overhead, both in terms of execution
time, and in terms of memory requirements.
