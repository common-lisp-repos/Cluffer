\section{Previous work}

\subsection{GNU Emacs}

GNU Emacs uses a so-called \emph{gap buffer} for the entire buffer of
text \cite{GNUEmacsLispReferenceManual} \cite{CraftOfTextEditiing}.  A
gap buffer can be thought of as a vector holding the items of the
buffer (typically characters) but with some additional free space.  In
a typical gap-buffer implementation, a possibly-empty \emph{prefix} of
the buffer contents is stored at the beginning of the vector, and a
possibly-empty \emph{suffix} of the contents is stored at the end of
the vector, leaving a possibly-empty \emph{gap} between the prefix and
the suffix.

\subsection{Multics Emacs}


Multics Emacs%
\footnote{The description in this section is a summary of the
  information found here: http://www.multicians.org/mepap.html}
used doubly-linked list of lines and each line was a
sequence of characters.  Special instructions were added to the GE
645...

\subsection{Climacs}

Like GNU Emacs, Climacs uses a gap buffer for the entire buffer.  It
avoids the bad case by using a circular buffer.  If fact, it uses
Flexichain \cite{flexichain}.

\subsection{Others}

Hemlock, Goatee, etc.
